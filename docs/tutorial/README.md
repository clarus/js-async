# Tutorial
In this tutorial we step through the main features of Redux Ship. We make some design choices, like following an [MVC pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) and using the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type system, but nothing is mandatory. Use what better fits your needs.
