> Scalable, testable and typable side effects for Redux

Redux Ship is a side effects handler for [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) which focuses on:

* **scalability:** you can reuse and compose sub-stores, thanks to the [`Ship.map`](https://clarus.github.io/redux-ship/docs/api.html) primitive;
* **testing:** you can run unit tests of your side effects, by taking snapshots of their live execution traces;
* **typing:** you can type check your code with (almost) full coverage in [Flow](https://flowtype.org/).

Inspired by:

* [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) for the composition mechanism and type checking;
* [Redux Saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga) for the use of generators to test side-effects;
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for the idea of [snapshot testing](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html#snapshot-testing).

See a [demo with reusable components and shared state](http://clarus.github.io/redux-ship/examples/gifs/).
